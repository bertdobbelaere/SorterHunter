# Forcing the uphill step (see EscapeRate) not to break a valid sorter. When set to >0, an inserted pair that would affect the sorting result will be changed into a duplicate of the next pair.

# Postfix network to finish the sorter. One application is to search for median detecting networks.
# e.g. to find a network just outputing the median of Ninputs=7 inputs, define postfix (0,1),(1,2),(0,1),(4,5),(5,6),(4,5), then find a sorter and just strip the postfix afterwards.
#Postfix=(4,5),(14,15)

# Specify initial network (after prefix, if applicable) as comma separated list of pairs. Inputs are 0 based.
# Pairs containing input indices >= Ninputs will be silently removed (allows reduction of larger known good networks)
# Note that if Symmetric=1 the pairs in InitialNetwork will be subject to mirroring and duplication.
# This feature can be used to try to improve an existing network. Default: empty.
#InitialNetwork=(0,1)
